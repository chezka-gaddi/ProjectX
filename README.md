## Release 4.01
## Fixed
- Range now properly scales the distance a projectile can travel. Previously, they were stuck at 6.

  - Radar = 4    - How far a tanks Radar expands to
  - Range = 4    - How many spaces a projectile travels per turn
  - Shots = 0    - This is a counter, no matter how many points you put here, it will stay 0.
- Reduced size of program.

## Release 3.01
### What's new?
- Object health
	- If you arn't a fan of the new objects, now you can do something about it.  Trees and rocks can both be destroyed with enough projectile hits.
	-Warning: You still cannot drive over rocks and will take damage if you try.  After they are destroyed you can safely move over them.
	- If you were tired of the paint on your tank fading, you can now sit under the shade of a tree.  This has the added benefit of taking a few hits from projectiles for you.
	- With the new objects means the obstacle map has been changed.  It is no longer a boolean array with simply occupied or not.  It now tells you if it's empty 0, a tree T or a rock R.  
	- Previous code will still work with empty = false and everything else = true, however your tank won't know to hide in a tree if you don't update it's routines.
	- NOTE: The map can still be setup to use old style obstacles which will appear on the GUI using the new images, but retain the original properties: Infinite health, unpassible, and damaging when trying to move.  In this mode they will appear as a 1 in the obstacle map.
- New Map System
	- Maps can now be parse from the config file as shown in the config.sample
	- Valid map symbols: R - Rock, T - Tree, B - Bush, O - Obstacle, and a space for empty
	- The width and height parameters are now mandatory so the config file parser knows how big to search
  - A smaller sample map has been included in the src folder.
- Updated loading messages so if something fails you know where. Maybe.
- Makefile update
	- The makefile was updated to allow the use of the structres found in the header files found in the src directory.  This means you can make your own mapData structure to save data instead of relying soley on the one provided each turn.
- Results.txt
	- The results.txt will now be created on a first run of the platform.  It will log all the players added to the map, and the winner of the game.  And append to the file if it exists.

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug where dead actors were causing a delay in turn processing.
- Partially, optimized turn checks for a small speed increase.  

## Release 2.04
### New Features
- The same boring objects are a thing of the past.  The game will now choose a random obstacle category when generating the map.  In addition to a random category, a random style will also be selected.

## Release 2.03
### New Features
- Added a new config.sample file that gives a template for how to setup a map file.
- If the makefile detects that no configuration file is present, it will automatically generate one from the config.sample file.
### Changes:
- The repository no longer stores a config.txt file.  This is to prevent a developers local copy from getting overwritten and to avoid merge conflicts.  This means that on a first clone the user will need to run 'make' once to generate a config.txt file if it does not exist.

## Release 2.02
### Fixes
- Problem with freshly made tanks not being able to find the constructor
- The game will display a message to console and exit when no config file is found
- Changed development pipeline to push to a pre-release branch before merging with master release

## Release 2.01
### What needs to change:
- All config.txt files will need to be updated with new image files.  The format is now:
	AI <AI Name> <x> <y> <Up Image> <Right Image> <Down Image> <Left Image> <Bullet Image>
	All images follow this format:
	images/<color>/tank<ColorLetter>_<direction>.png
	images/<color>/bullet<ColorLetter>.png
	For the blue tank:
		images/Blue/tankB_U.png 
		images/Blue/tankB_R.png 
		images/Blue/tankB_D.png 
		images/Blue/tankB_L.png 
		images/Blue/bulletB.png

### What's New?
- Radar
	- The Radar stat is what determines how far around the tank it can see.  If you 
		have a Radar stat of 2, you will only be able to see objects 2 spaces away from 
		you.
- Random Objects
	- The platform will now select from a pool of objects during object placement on
		the map.  The current two options are:  Tree, or Rock.
- Map Scaling
	- The map size can now be changed in the configuration settings between 15x9 to 
		40 x 20
- Idle Speed Adjustment
	- The idle speed can be changed within the configuration file.  Currently, this will
		only affect the time between turns.
- Restructuring of Images
	- Added two new colors for tanks and projectiles.  And restructured them based on their 
	affiliated color.
	- Restructured Objects into folders based on type

### Fixes
- Deconstructor is now called for custom tanks instead of relying on the parent.
- Changed configuration file to account for Radar instead of Range.
- Tanks are now limited to only pending the allowed number of attribute points.
- You will no longer get a message for an incorrect number of attribute points spent
	if you were within the limit.

## Release 1.04
### Whats New?
- Added checks for tanks cheating and adding too many attributes points to their
stats

## Release 1.03
### What's New?
- A new example tank has been added to show the basics of movment and shooting
- Fixed Bugs associated to parsing the config file,
    - The config file can now load up to 4 tanks
    - The config file also now error checking so invalid options are ignored and
set to defaults
- Improved the effeciency of the game manager so tank moves process faster
